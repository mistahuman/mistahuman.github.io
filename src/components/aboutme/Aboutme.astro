  Hi, I’m Marco — a freelance Software Engineer and Full Stack Developer with a background in
  safety-critical systems and modern web applications.
</p>
<p class="mb-2">
  Before moving into software, I earned a Master’s Degree in Energy and Nuclear Engineering. Over
  time, I shifted my focus toward building reliable and efficient software — from backend systems
  that handle complex logic to frontends designed for clarity and performance.
</p>
<p class="mb-2">
  My experience spans from developing ERTMS communication protocols to crafting web tools that make
  everyday work simpler and faster. I enjoy tackling technical challenges, streamlining processes,
  and turning ideas into solid, maintainable solutions.
</p>
<p class="mb-2">
  I’m always open to interesting collaborations or freelance projects. Feel free to reach out if
  you’d like to build something together.
